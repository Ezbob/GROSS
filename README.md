# GROSS #
The GROovy Satisfiability Solver

Build using.. You guess it! __Groovy__! (with gradle as the build and dependency toolkit)

### How to build it ###
If you want to build it then you can just use the gradle wrapper "gradlew".

Running "gradle tasks" should give you an overview what you can do.

Happy solving!
### Requirements ###

As Groovy is a dialect of the Java programming language, it relies on a installation of the Java Virtual Machine to run.
The solver was buildt using Groovy version 2.4.6 and Java version 1.7 .
